# Email-Spam-Classification-and-Representation-Learning

In this project, I used labelled email dataset to identify the spam emails. After understanding the distribution of the emails and some interesting words used in the spam emails, I used undersampling technique to balance the imbalance between the spam and non-spam emails. I used k-nn and Random Forest classifier and weighted-F1 score as the metric of evaluation. 

Further I used Neural network on a fashion dataset - which includes 10 classes of clothing apparel types for example: t-shirts, tops, trousers, pullovers etc. t-SNE is used to reduce the dimension of the data and then various deep learning models are used to capture the representation in the images.

The code with all the insights is available here:
